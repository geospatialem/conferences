## Introductions
* Presenter: [Amy Gebhardt](http://www.twitter.com/amlyhamm)

## Vocabulary
* **_Repo_**: project folder (Git leprechauns).
* **_Clone_**: A copy of the Repo.
* **_Git_**: A program to track your Changes.
* **_Hashed commit_**: Unique IDs for commits (GitHub does this).
* **_Add_**: Add a file, or files, to the repository to be tracked.
* **_Stage_**: Tell Git to track the current state of the file.
* **_Commit_**: Saves the changes made to a file, not the file as a whole. The commit will have a "hash" so we can track which changes were committed when and by whom.
* **_Branch_**: A parallel version of a repo.
* **_Master_**: Default branch name on GitHub.
* **_Remote_**: Version of a repo on GitHub.
* **_Fetch_**: Get the latest changes from an online repo without merging (`git fetch`).
* **_Pull_**: Fetch and merge from the remote repo.
* **_Push_**: Send commits to the remote repo.
* **_Fork_**: A personal copy of another user's repo.
* **_Pull Request_**: Push your local changes to another user's repo, in hopes they will pull your code request to their repo to benefit others!
* **_Touch_**: Creates a new file (e.g. `touch .gitignore`).
* **_SSH Keys_**: Like a fingerprint, adds extra security to your GitHub account.  
* **_Tags_**: Used for creating stable releases.  

## Shortcuts
* Hit the `^` arrow to get the last run command in Terminal.
* Click `Tab` to finish the word/phrase you are typing.

### Tidbit
When you run into  `VIM` (text editor), do the following (also noted in [this StackOverflow message](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14046122/github-locks-up-mac-terminal-when-using-pull-command)):  
1. Press `i`, a.k.a. insert, to insert the necessary message.  
2. Enter in the message necessary (no quotes, straight up text here is legitimite).  
3. Press `esc` to get to the prompt and then one of the following:  
a. `Shift` + `Z` + `Z`, or  
b. `:wq` (which is 1970's technology that means `w`: write, `q`: quit).  

## Version Control
Benefits include: collaborative environment, and the ability to track changes over time (esp. with groups of people)!

### Types
* Centralized
* Distributed (e.g. GitHub)

## Clone a Repo
### Straight up
`git clone [remote-location]`

### Rename the clone
`git clone [remote-location] [clone-name]`

### Project remotes
`git remote -v`

## How To Make a Repo

### 1. Create a Repo
To create a repo straight on GitHub, use the web tools to create one. There is a download option that can make repos with the command line named Hub. Check it out to learn more.

To create a repo on you desktop, without first making one on the web browser, run the following commands in Terminal:  

`mkdir [repo-name-here]`  
`cd [repo-name-here]`  

### 2. Initialize
`git init`  
`git status`  

### 3. Add a new file
`git add [file-name-here.ext]`  

## Undo Your Changes
Nobody's perfect. Sometimes you'll want to "undo" or "revert" some changes you've made.

Also, check out some awesome tweets that Nathan sent out! Such as [Git Alias'](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases). Get all the information from the [Twitter discussion](https://twitter.com/GeospatialEM/status/649747875962875904).

P.S. **_AMAZING!_**

### Unstaged files
`git checkout [file-name-here]`  

### Staged files
`git reset HEAD [file-name-here]`  
`git checkout [file-name-here]`  

### Revert to a specific commit
Copy from Terminal and/or GitHub website, then run the following in Terminal:  
`git revert [commit-hash-here]`  

### Merge error  
A merge error is where you have made changes to the repo but conflicting changes exist locally. For example, if you committed changes to the repo, and want to pull them locally but the changes would override your local copy.  

During a merge error, you'll receive the following message:  
```  
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:  
  <List-Of-Files>  
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.  
Aborting  
```  

To resolve the conflict(s), you have three options:  

#### Option 1: Commit the change  
Type `git commit -m "My message"`  

#### Option 2: Stash it  
Stashing acts as a stack, where you can push changes, and you pop them in reverse order.  

1. To stash type: `git stash`  
2. Do the merge, and then pull the stash: `git stash pop`  

#### Option 3: Discard the local changes   
Using `git reset --hard`  

## Branches
A parallel version of a repo. `master` is GitHub's default branch. **A branch is a new ending to a novel.** Also, think of branches like components of a tree, like a tree branch!  

1. Same repo, with hopes of adding a new story in.  
2. `master` branch is left alone when doing large changes. Changes are normally merged into the `master` when completed.
3. Merge in a branch when you are ready, and after you have verified it works (usually back to the `master` branch).

### Create a Branch
`git checkout -b <branch-name-here>`  
`git status` will tell you the branch that you are in.  

### Create a Branch from a Specified Branch (not master)  
`git checkout -b <new-branch-name-here> <already-created-branch>`  

Once you are ready to commit, do your normal commit messages, then run the following to push to the same named branch:  
`git push origin <new-branch-name-here>`

### Switch Branches
`git branch`: See all branches in the repo.   
`git checkout master`: Checkout the `master` branch.  

### Delete a Branch

**Origin Remote**:  
`git push origin :[branch-name-here]` (e.g. `git push origin :master`)  

**Locally**:  
`git branch -d [branch-name-here]`  

### Delete the Master (`master`) branch, and add a GitHub pages (`gh-pages`) branch  
1. Create the *gh-pages* branch locally (your machine), and switch to the branch:  
`git checkout -b gh-pages`  
2. Push the *gh-pages* branch to the origin (on GitHub):  
`git push origin gh-pages`  
3. Add the remote, or connection, between your origin and local copies:  
`git remote add gh-pages`  
4. Delete the origin *master* branch (on GitHub):  
`git push origin :master`  
5. Delete the *master* branch locally (on your machine):  
`git branch -d master`  

### Merge a Branch
a.k.a. collaboration at its best!

1. **Checkout the Branch** `git checkout master`. The branch you checkout will be the one you will be merging your changes to.

2. **Merge a Different Branch**: `git merge [branch-name-here]`. The branch you merge is what will be added to the branch you have checked out! **_WOOT!_** P.S. `git rebase` also works, but was not covered during our session.  

### Branch Conflicts
Git will make you resolve conflicts before merging. When you try and run a merge and run into conflicts your file will change to show you the conflicts in your file(s). From here, edit them as you wish for them to appear. Then use `git commit -m '[your message goes here]'` to commit the changes. **_Hooray!_**  

### Merge edits from master to a working branch  

1. Checkout the branch you are working in: `git checkout <working-branch-name>`  

2. Get up-to-date with the origin `git fetch origin`  

3. Merge in the changes on the master branch. `git merge origin/master`  

If any conflicts arise, Git will tell you and you will be able to edit them as they present themselves. Once you are satisfied do a commit message and push, as you normally would. You can do the third step above to verify your edits are the same as the master once completed.  

### Checkout a remote branch  
If a branch exists remotely, go out to Git and **fetch** it, then checkout the branch. 

This is useful when you have an issue/error within the branch, in which you can delete your local copy, fetch the branches from the remote, and checkout the repo version of the branch. Hooray!

```
git fetch
git checkout [branch-name-here]
```

## Fork/Forking
Use/Contribute to a repo owned by someone else. Forking creates a personal copy in your account of someone else's repo. A fork makes it easy for you to modify the code, and for contributions, if the owner chooses to accept your changes.  

### Update a fork  
Add the remote, call it "upstream":  
`git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git`  

Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches, such as upstream/master:  
`git fetch upstream`  

 Make sure that you're on your master branch:  
`git checkout master`  

Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that other branch:  
`git rebase upstream/master`  

## Pull Requests
After forking and cloning, any changes you push will go to **your local repo** (not the original repo you forked). However, you can contribute back to the original repo by submitting a pull request to the owner.

There is also a way for you to commit your changes **and** submit a pull request simultaneously using some awesome Git commands. Check out the GitHub Help section for more information on this awesomeness.  

## Tags  
Tags are used for creating stable releases.

### List Tags  
```
git tag
```  

To view a list of tags, in alphabetical order, run:
```
git tag -1
```  
To view tag details (not applicable to lightweight tags), run:
```
git show v1.0.0
```

### Creating Tags
To create a tag, first, ensure that you're following the tag naming convention, for example 1.0.0.

Annotated tags are stored as full objects in the Git database. They are checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). It’s generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you can have all this information; but if you want a temporary tag or for some reason don’t want to keep the other information, lightweight tags are available too.

To create an annotated tag run the following:  
```
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m 'version 1.0.0'
```  

To create a lightweight tag, run the following:  
```
git tag v1.0.0-lw
```  

### Push the Tag
Once the tag is created, push the tag to the master repo by appending the `--tags` flag, like so:
```
git push --tags
```  

### Check the Tags  
To check and confirm remote tags run:  
```
git tag -1
```  

### Deleting Tags
```
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v1.0.0
# Delete remote tag on Gitlab/Github
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
```

## Removing files

```
git rm <file-name>
```

### Removing weird file names  
When removing file names with quotes (e.g. `"` or `'`), such as `"tatn\303\207\302\242us"` perform the following:  
```
git rm tatn*
```
This will remove all of the files matching the pattern defined, in this case with `tatn`. [More information](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23808611/git-checkout-remove-file-with-special-characters/23809099#23809099).  

## Check files diff from origin (before git push)  
Check the files that will be pushed using Git by running the following command with the origin's branch name:  
```
git diff --stat --cached origin/<branchName>
```
